# Hello-World
Hooray! My first repository on GitHub
I'm a writer, lapsed filmmaker, and dreamer. One of the missing components in my toolbox is coding, and that's why I'm here. Grew up in Wyoming, spent the 90s in Los Angeles, traveled for a bit, and now I live in Arizona with my wife...and our dog. Life is great.
